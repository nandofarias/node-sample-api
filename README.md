# Node Sample API
Bootstrap of a Node API

## Motivation
As an avid Medium reader, I've read a lot of Node.js articles and tutorials, so I decided to create a simple TODO API using Node 8.4.0 with some new JS features like async await, spread operators, Object and Array new methods. This example was built using Express 4 and Sequelize 4, which brings us more flexibility using sequelize models.

## Commands

- Install
```bash
npm install
```

- Test
```bash
npm test
# or
npx mocha ./test/unit/**/**.js
```

- Run
```bash
npm start
# or
npx nodemon
```
